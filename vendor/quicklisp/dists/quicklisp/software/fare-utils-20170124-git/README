fare-utils is a package full of miscellaneous code that I've used at one point
or the other while hacking Common Lisp code: macros, functions, classes,
offering a variety of classic utilities and datastructures, plus management of package.

At the insistence of several hackers, I hereby state what is obvious to me,
that they can reuse any software released under the bugroff license
and publish it as part or totality of packages under any other license
they see fit, if it really matters to them, including a BSD-style license
or a MIT license. Yes they can. Of course, if they choose a proprietary
software license, they only deserve scorn. But even that, they may do!


Reasonably debugged (test suite included):
* pure data structures (avl-trees, hash-tables, fmim)

Somewhat debugged (need to write a test suite):
* stateful binary-heaps

Untested:
* stateful binomial-heaps

Work In Progress:
* basic-utilities
* containers

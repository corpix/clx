Like several other projects on Common-Lisp.net, Moptilities
provides a compatibility layer for minor MOP implementation
differences. More importantly, it adds some handy reflection
capabilities. [TINAA][] documentation is [available][project-documentation].

### Mailing Lists

Moptilities has a single mailing list:

  * [moptilities-devel][devel-list]: A list for questions,
    patches, bug reports, and so on; It's for everything
    other than

If that doesn't work or if the response isn't timely, try 
emailing [me][mailto:gwking@metabang.com] directly.

### Where is it

metabang.com is slowly switching from [darcs][] to [git][]
for source control; the current git repository is on
[github][github-moptilities] and you can clone it using:

    git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/moptilities

Moptilities is [ASDF installable][asdf-install]. Its CLiki home is
right [where][cliki-home] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][tarball].

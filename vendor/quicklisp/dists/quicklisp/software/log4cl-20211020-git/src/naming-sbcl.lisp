(defun include-block-debug-name? (debug-name)
  "Figures out if we should include the debug-name into the stack of
nested blocks..  Should return the symbol to use.

For now SBCL seems to use:

  SYMBOL => normal defun block
  (LABELS SYMBOL) => inside of labels function
  (FLET SYMBOL)   => inside of flet function
  (LAMBDA (arglist) => inside of anonymous lambda
  (SB-PCL::FAST-METHOD SYMBOL ...) for defmethod
  (SB-PCL::VARARGS-ENTRY (SB-PCL::FAST-METHOD SYMBOL )) for defmethod with &rest parametwer
  (SB-C::HAIRY-ARG-PROCESSOR SYMBOL) => for functions with complex lambda lists

In all of the above cases except LAMBDA we simply return SYMBOL, for
LAMBDA we return the word LAMBDA and NIL for anything else.

Example: As a result of this default logger name for SBCL for the
following form:

   (defmethod foo ()
     (labels ((bar ()
                (funcall (lambda ()
                           (flet ((baz ()
                                    (log-info \"test\")))
                             (baz))))))
       (bar)))

will be: package.foo.bar.baz

(defun emacs-helper (backend info)
  "Perform action, or return requested data for Emacs logger manipulation.
This is a multiplexed service routine to manage loggers from the Emacs
lisp support package (log4cl.el).  The argument INFO is a plist
encoding the elisp request.  Logger manipulation or information
retrieval is determined by the value associated with the :action key.

The :action key takes on one of three values:
- :info - return data needed to construct a log level menu
- :set - set a loggerâ€™s logging level
- :get-location - return source file and position of a function

When action is :info, a plist is returned, which is used to construct
a log level menu.  On the elisp side this log level menu is attached
to either the pull down/pull right menu in the menu bar or the pop up
context menu associated with a right mouse click in the repl buffer.

The  requested log level menu is one of four types:
- root logger - :root t
- file logger - :package and :file parameters supplied
- category logger - :package and :package-offset (character
  displacement into package name) parameters are used to determine
  category.
  There may be a :rest-all <function-name> parameter, if requested for
  the context menu, but this is ignored.
- function logger - :package <package-name> and :rest <function-name>
The :info response is a plist reflecting the selected logger.  This
includes:
- :package - package name
- :display-name - menu title
- :level - current level or nil
- :inherited-level - log level inherited from an ancestor
- :children-level-count - number of subcategory loggers

When :action is :set, further parameters determine which logger level
to set.  This can be:
- The root logger - selected by :root t
- A file logger - selected by :file <file-name>, though :package is
  also passed, :package is ignored.
- A category logger - selected by :package <package-name> and
  :package-offset <num> (a byte displacement into the <package-name>
  string).
- A function logger - selected by :package <package-name> and :rest
  <function-name>
The new logger level is requested by :level <num>|:reset.  When :level
is :reset, the selected logger and its children are cleared.
The response to a :set request is a list of two numbers: the new and
old log levels.

When :action is :get-location, the request contains:
- :package and :package-offset used to identify category as in the
  category log level menu request, as above
- :rest-all names the function to be looked up
The :get-location response is a plist containing keys :file,
:position, and :snippet describing the location of the function and
surrounding text.

This service routine leverages Swank or Slynk backend features to look
up package, function, and logger information.  The argument BACKEND is
used to dispatch generic function defined above to access the
appropriate backend interface.

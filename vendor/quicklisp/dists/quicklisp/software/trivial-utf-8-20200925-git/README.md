## 2 Introduction

Trivial UTF-8 is a small library for doing UTF-8-based in- and
output on a Lisp implementation that already supports Unicode -
meaning `CHAR-CODE` and `CODE-CHAR` deal with Unicode character codes.

The rationale for the existence of this library is that while
Unicode-enabled implementations usually do provide some kind of
interface to dealing with character encodings, these are typically
not terribly flexible or uniform.

The [Babel][babel] library solves a similar problem while
understanding more encodings. Trivial UTF-8 was written before Babel
existed, but for new projects you might be better off going with
Babel. The one plus that Trivial UTF-8 has is that it doesn't depend
on any other libraries.

## 4 Reference

<a id='x-28TRIVIAL-UTF-8-3AUTF-8-BYTE-LENGTH-20FUNCTION-29'></a>

- [function] **UTF-8-BYTE-LENGTH** *STRING*

    Calculate the amount of bytes needed to encode `STRING`.

<a id='x-28TRIVIAL-UTF-8-3ASTRING-TO-UTF-8-BYTES-20FUNCTION-29'></a>

- [function] **STRING-TO-UTF-8-BYTES** *STRING &KEY NULL-TERMINATE*

    Convert `STRING` into an array of unsigned bytes containing its UTF-8
    representation. If `NULL-TERMINATE`, add an extra 0 byte at the end.

<a id='x-28TRIVIAL-UTF-8-3AUTF-8-GROUP-SIZE-20FUNCTION-29'></a>

- [function] **UTF-8-GROUP-SIZE** *BYTE*

    Determine the amount of bytes that are part of the character whose
    encoding starts with `BYTE`. May signal [`UTF-8-DECODING-ERROR`][3993].

<a id='x-28TRIVIAL-UTF-8-3AUTF-8-BYTES-TO-STRING-20FUNCTION-29'></a>

- [function] **UTF-8-BYTES-TO-STRING** *BYTES &KEY (START 0) (END (LENGTH BYTES))*

    Convert the `START`, `END` subsequence of the array of `BYTES` containing
    UTF-8 encoded characters to a `STRING`. The element type of `BYTES` may
    be anything as long as it can be `COERCE`d into an `(UNSIGNED-BYTES
    8)` array. May signal [`UTF-8-DECODING-ERROR`][3993].

<a id='x-28TRIVIAL-UTF-8-3AREAD-UTF-8-STRING-20FUNCTION-29'></a>

- [function] **READ-UTF-8-STRING** *INPUT &KEY NULL-TERMINATED STOP-AT-EOF (CHAR-LENGTH -1) (BYTE-LENGTH -1)*

    Read UTF-8 encoded data from `INPUT`, a byte stream, and construct a
    string with the characters found. When `NULL-TERMINATED` is given,
    stop reading at a null character. If `STOP-AT-EOF`, then stop at
    `END-OF-FILE` without raising an error. The `CHAR-LENGTH` and
    `BYTE-LENGTH` parameters can be used to specify the max amount of
    characters or bytes to read, where -1 means no limit. May signal
    [`UTF-8-DECODING-ERROR`][3993].
